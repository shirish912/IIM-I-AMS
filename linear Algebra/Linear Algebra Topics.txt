1. Intro to LA
2. Understanding Scalers, Vectors & Matrices
3. Code implementation
4. Basic Array Operations & properties (shape, size, ndim)
5. MAtrix Operations: 
- addition, substration, division, multiplication (element-wise)>>> the shapes of the two matrices must be exactly the same
- proper matrix multiplication >>> np.matmul, np.dot  >> inner dimensions must match
- matrix transpose, reshape, trace, det, inverse,

6. Types of MAtrices: Square, Diagonal, Identity, Zeros, Ones, Sparse, 
7. Rank of Matrix
8. Vector Spaces and Subspaces
9. Vector Dot Product & Vector Norms >>> application (cosine similarity)
10. Matrix Spaces: Row space, Col space, Null space
11. Matrix Factorization: LU, QR, EVD, SVD
12. PCA Example
13. Linear Regression
