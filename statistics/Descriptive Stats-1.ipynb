    "### 1. Types of Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Categorical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nominal Variables**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Nominal variables, also known as categorical variables, are used for labeling or naming attributes without any quantitative value. The categories do not have a logical order or ranking.\n",
    "- **Examples**: \n",
    "  - **Gender**: Male, Female, Non-binary\n",
    "  - **Marital Status**: Single, Married, Divorced, Widowed\n",
    "  - **Country**: USA, Canada, Mexico, Brazil\n",
    "  - **Favorite Color**: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinal Variables**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Ordinal variables are categorical variables with a clear, meaningful order or ranking among the categories. However, the differences between the ranks are not measurable or consistent.\n",
    "- **Examples**: \n",
    "  - **Movie Ratings**: Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good, Excellent\n",
    "  - **Education Level**: High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD\n",
    "  - **Socioeconomic Status**: Low, Middle, High\n",
    "  - **Pain Severity**: None, Mild, Moderate, Severe\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numerical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical variables can be divided into discrete and continuous variables, and further into interval and ratio scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discrete Variables**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Discrete variables represent countable quantities and take on a finite or countably infinite set of values. Each value is distinct and separate.\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - **Number of Children**: 0, 1, 2, 3\n",
    "  - **Number of Cars in a Parking Lot**: 5, 10, 15\n",
    "  - **Number of Students in a Class**: 20, 25, 30\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuous Variables**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Continuous variables represent measurable quantities and can take on infinitely many values within a given range. The values can be any number, including fractions and decimals.\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - **Height**: 160.5 cm, 172.3 cm\n",
    "  - **Weight**: 65.2 kg, 70.5 kg\n",
    "  - **Temperature**: 36.5°C, 98.6°F\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interval Scale**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Interval variables are continuous variables where the differences between values are meaningful. However, there is no true zero point, and ratios are not meaningful.\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - **Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit**: The difference between 20°C and 30°C is the same as between 30°C and 40°C, but 0°C is not the absence of temperature.\n",
    "  - **Calendar Years**: The difference between the years 2000 and 2010 is the same as between 1990 and 2000, but there is no absolute zero year.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ratio Scale**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Ratio variables are continuous variables with a true zero point, meaning zero indicates the absence of the quantity. Both differences and ratios between values are meaningful.\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - **Height**: A height of 0 cm means no height. Ratios like \"twice as tall\" are meaningful.\n",
    "  - **Weight**: A weight of 0 kg means no weight. Ratios like \"half as heavy\" are meaningful.\n",
    "  - **Income**: An income of $0 means no income. Comparing incomes as ratios is meaningful.\n",
